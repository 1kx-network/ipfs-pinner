# ipfs-pinner
- go client for IPFS pinning service api
- extended support for custom file upload endpoints provided by pinata, web3.storage etc.
- client side CAR file and deterministic CID generation.

# generate go http client go bindings via openapi
- use `./generate_gobindings.sh` to generate the golang bindings. There are some fixes you
  would need to do (missing braces etc.)
